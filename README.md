# ManetGraph

## Klement:
- [ ] Flow implementation
- [ ] Complete WaveFormPropagationModel 
- [ ] IdealPropagationModel
- [ ] Propagation model using Free-space path loss and Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem for bitrate computation
 
 
## Eike: 
- [x] ConsoleApp
  - [x] TreeParser (builds tree based command set)
- [ ] Adjust/Fix Generators (limit number of connections based on given playground)
- [ ] Add multiple colored paths to VisualGraph (paint colored lines under edges with different sizes to enable overlapping paths)


## Ideas:
- Plo technique 
- JFrame with GUI Features (Buttons?)
