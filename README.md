# ManetModel

## Klement:
- [ ] WaveFormPropagationModel 
  - [x] AffectedLinks
  - [ ] Link capacity 
- [x] IdealPropagationModel
- [ ] Propagation model using Free-space path loss and Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem for bitrate computation
 
## Eike: 
###### Panel:
- [ ] Adjust scaling for different screen resolutions

## Ideas:
- Results as Plots in JFrame
  - Waht kind of results? How should they look like?
- Units representing flow bitrate (mbit...)
  
## Discussion:
- Utilization as property of Links
- Getter/setter for RadioOccupationModel
- Interface to grant access to vertexAdjacencies in WeightedUndirectedGraph
